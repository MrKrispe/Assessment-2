# Assessment 2 – Student Projects (Kris)

## About

This repository contains my work for Assessment 2:
- **Student Grade Tracker:** A simple Python program that lets users enter student names and grades, saves them, and shows the class average.
- **Simple Notes App:** A Python program to write, read, and search notes saved to a text file.

All code is beginner-friendly and commented for clarity.

## Student Grade Tracker

**File:** `student_grade_tracker.py`

**Description:**  
Lets the user enter multiple students’ names and grades, then prints them all and calculates/shows the average for the class.

**Key Python Features Demonstrated:**
- Input/output (`input()`, `print()`)
- Lists (arrays): storing names and grades
- Loops: for collecting student info and printing results
- Calculations: averaging grades
- Comments: each major step is explained in code

## Simple Notes App

**File:** `simple_notes_app.py`

**Description:**  
Lets a user write notes, read all notes, or search notes for a keyword. All notes are saved to and loaded from a text file.

**Key Python Skills Demonstrated:**
- File handling (reading and writing text files)
- Loops and conditionals (for menu and search)
- Functions for code organization
- Simple string manipulation
- Input/output for the menu system

## Instructions

Just run either file with Python 3. You’ll see clear prompts in the console.

## Collaboration and Assessment Evidence

This repo is for my individual submission.  
- Group collaboration was tracked on Discord (chat log available on request).
- Team resources, like Matt’s repo ([see here](https://github.com/mbseedbox/Programming-Assignment)), were used as technical reference points for comparing code structure and output.
